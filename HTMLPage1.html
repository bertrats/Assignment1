        Hi my name is Travis Bertram. I am a fifth year Information Technology Software Development Major. I really enjoy playing sports, hanging out with friends, and doing new stuff. I look forward to learn about game development in this class because I dont have any experience in it.
        I have completed five co-ops. My first two co-ops were at Assurex Health where I was a User Experienece Designer, my third one was at Car-part.com where I was a web developer,
        and my fourth and fifth were at Siemens PLM where I was a software developer.
